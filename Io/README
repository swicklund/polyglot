Contains snippets and projects from the Io section of Seven Languages in Seven Weeks by Bruce A. Tate

From the Io website:

==

Io is a prototype-based programming language inspired by Smalltalk (all values are objects, all messages are dynamic), 
Self (prototype-based), NewtonScript (differential inheritance), Act1 (actors and futures for concurrency), 
LISP (code is a runtime inspectable/modifiable tree) and Lua (small, embeddable).
